# accessibility-refactor-project
The current HTML webpage requires improvements notably around accessibility as it lacks in that domain. Ensuring webpages meet certain accessibility guidelines allows audiences with disabilities/ requirements to navigate the webpages with ease. In order to achieve this, this project requires refactoring an existing HTML webpage with accessibility as the focal area of improvement. This project also includes refactoring the code for titles, semantic html elements, accessible alt attributes as well as keeping the order logical and clear. 

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:
GIVEN I have access to edit a website
WHEN I edit the source code of the website, in light of accessibility
THEN the source code should include semantic HTML elements/ tags

GIVEN I have access to edit a website
WHEN I edit the source code of the website, in light of accessibility
THEN the HTML elements follows a clear/ logical structure

GIVEN I have access to edit a website
WHEN I edit the source code of the website, in light of accessibility
THEN Image, icon elements should contain accessible alt attributes

THEN heading attributes fall in a sequential order in the html source code

GIVEN I have access to edit a website
WHEN I edit the source code of the website, in light of accessibility
THEN Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Challenges
The short project presented challenges relating to the css styling of various html elements that had to be grouped together in the same alignment. As well as accessibility improvements to the webpage namely by including the alternative text tags and aria labels for a few of the elements. 

## Things I learnt
I learnt how to use the external css file to add styling to my html page alongside improving the display of the elements such as header and images. I improved my understanding on the accessibility requirements in html by using certain labels such as aria-label, alternative text and titles.
